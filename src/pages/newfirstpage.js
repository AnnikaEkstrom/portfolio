          <Link to="/projects">Other than relaxing in nice places</Link>, I also love to code.
          I work in a  cool tech company where I code video ads.
          Most of the code is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but
           I also personally code in React. Except for
           coding, I get to dive into the Adobe Programs
           to edit videos and photos and create cool effects. I learnt
           coding through a boot camp and I keep developing
           width a mindset of learning exactly what I want. In addition
           I actually also teach coding with Tjejer Kodar.

          Except coding ads in a creative way, I have also learnt
          several of the Adobe Programs such as Premiere and Photoshop.
          There are amazing creatives that is done with a combination of
          Adobe-solutions and coding, this is what fascinates me in my
          working days and what keeps inspiring mw to learn more in coding.
