                  Hi, my name is Annika. I am passionate about coding and constantly want to learn more.
                  <br />
                  I mainly work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I am also a fan of React and Node.

              <h1>MY BACKGROUND</h1>
              <p>I have mainly worked in sales where my
                focus has been on building long
              lasting customer relationships. My previous
              roles have also included project management,
              marketing, customer support and personnel
              responsibility. A few years ago, I got interested in programming so I quit my
              job and learnt programming.
              </p>

            <div className="info future">
              <h1>MY FUTURE</h1>
              <p>With service in mind, I want to continue learning more HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                React and Node and work with projects
                where I can add value with my combination of
                service-mindeness and web development.
